# _KNN-Classification of Music_

## Project Description
A KNN Classification model built manually using only Numpy to categorise 10 different music genres (or classes). Data was originally in audio format so feature extraction was required before modelling. Performance of manually constructed KNN is the same as the KNN model from the Scikit-Learn library. Where majority class of neighbours is > 1, the class neighbour with the shortest distance (Euclidean) is chosen (this can be changed to select majority class randomly). Scope of this project is to see how well a memory-based algorithm copes with classes with similar features. Please read the report for a more detailed analysis.
