# _KNN-Classification of Music_

## Summary
A KNN Classification model built using only Numpy to categorise 10 different music genres. Data was originally in audio format so feature extraction was required before modelling. Performance of manually constructed KNN is the same as the KNN model from the Scikit-Learn library. Please read the report for a more detailed analysis.
